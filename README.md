## <h3>DOM Manipulation in JavaScript</h3>
DOM manipulation is a fundamental aspect of web development, allowing developers to dynamically change the content, structure, and style of web pages.

## :medal_sports:<span style="color:#29c4f6">INTRODUCTION
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of nodes, with each node being an object representing a part of the document. JavaScript can be used to manipulate these nodes, allowing for dynamic updates to the content and structure of web pages.

1. Use the getElementById method to retrieve the target div element.
2. Properly store the fetched element in a variable for further manipulation.
3. Change the background color of the fetched div element to yellow using the style.backgroundColor property. 
4. Add a margin of 20 pixels to the element using the style.margin property.
5. Apply a padding of 10 pixels using the style.padding property.
6. Apply a padding of 10 pixels using the style.padding property.
